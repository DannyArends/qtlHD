# R/qtlHD

R/qtlHD (or qtlHD) is the next generation implementation of
[R/qtl][rqtl]. qtlHD is aimed at QTL analysis of high-density,
high-throughput data; for example for RNA-seq.

## Compiling qtlHD

To compile qtlHD a recent edition of the [D compiler][D] is needed:

    DMD32 D Compiler v2.053

After D installation, try the build and test script:

    ./test_all.sh
